Outline(3/19)

Introduction
Rivers and streams have maintained and modified ecosystems by mediating ecosystem structure and facilitating nutrient cycling for billions of years, but in recent years, water sources have become increasingly controlled and altered by humans, such as building dams and climate change.
The catchment area is a collection of rainfall over a natural drainage area.  In hydrolysis, it's the partition, storage, and release of water. The catchment area can also be used to study and model the water balance of an area. 
The runoff ratio, or the fraction of runoff generated by a given amount of precipitation, is how we measure hydrolysis and watershed in a given area. It's the proportion of rainfall that does not infiltrate(not absorbed into the catchment), and is not taken up by evapotranspiration, and thus ends up as runoff. 
we will need to calculate the slope of all runoff coefficients from daily data for each stream, then plot these slopes against a number of x-values (for example, number of dams or latitude) to identify characteristics of basins with highly changing runoff coefficients
divide slope by mean to get percent change
do it years at a time, not all of the data we have
we will identify characteristics common in basins with highly changing runoffs to quantify how much human activity impacts water runoff globally

Results: What we're looking for

Name general basin characteristics
what kinds of basins tend to have highly changing runoff ratios? for example, certain soil types, certain precipitation levels, etc
identify cities/geographical areas based on above basin characteristics
show us which parts of the world are most affected by changing runoff ratios
predict areas that are likely to be susceptible to changing runoff ratios in the future
figures
box and whisker plot for statistically significant basin characteristics
world (or US) map marking percent change of runoff ratios per location
empirical distribution for the prob of local spatial similarity in streamflow metric
