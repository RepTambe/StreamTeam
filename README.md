# StreamTeam

Outline(3/19)

Introduction
Rivers and streams have maintained and modified ecosystems by mediating ecosystem structure and facilitating nutrient cycling for billions of years, but in recent years, water sources have become increasingly controlled and altered by humans, such as building dams and climate change.
The catchment area is a collection of rainfall over a natural drainage area.  In hydrolysis, it's the partition, storage, and release of water. The catchment area can also be used to study and model the water balance of an area. 
The runoff ratio, or the fraction of runoff generated by a given amount of precipitation, is how we measure hydrolysis and watershed in a given area. It's the proportion of rainfall that does not infiltrate(not absorbed into the catchment), and is not taken up by evapotranspiration, and thus ends up as runoff. 
we will need to calculate the slope of all runoff coefficients from daily data for each stream, then plot these slopes against a number of x-values (for example, number of dams or latitude) to identify characteristics of basins with highly changing runoff coefficients
divide slope by mean to get percent change
do it years at a time, not all of the data we have
we will identify characteristics common in basins with highly changing runoffs to quantify how much human activity impacts water runoff globally

Results: What we're looking for

Name general basin characteristics
what kinds of basins tend to have highly changing runoff ratios? for example, certain soil types, certain precipitation levels, etc
identify cities/geographical areas based on above basin characteristics
show us which parts of the world are most affected by changing runoff ratios
predict areas that are likely to be susceptible to changing runoff ratios in the future
figures
box and whisker plot for statistically significant basin characteristics
world (or US) map marking percent change of runoff ratios per location
empirical distribution for the prob of local spatial similarity in streamflow metric

Methods:



The data is contained in BoxDrive. The files are a few GBS. To avoid downloading them to your computer, we will use the Box app instead.

To get the files on your loacl machine follow these steps:

1.
follow this link to get access to the files from your box account. 
https://byu.box.com/s/oqvmb58twh5c84xbvg7egecnlhdw8syr

2.
Once the files are shared on your Box, download the box app onto your personal computer using this link. Make sure you select the correct operating system of your device.
https://www.box.com/resources/downloads

3.
Once you get the app download, check your file explorer for the box tab. Click the tab and the folder named "Stream Team Dream Team" should be present. Click the folder and the databases will be there. This image below is an example of the boxapp in windows file explorer.

4.
To get the files to your IDE of choice, you have to copy the direct path from file Explorer.
From the file explorer, right click on the file you want
Click on properties.
Properties contains the direct path minus the file name. You will need to copy the direct path and write in the file name when you want to read the csv's in your code.
Make sure you swith the backslashes to forward slahes. 
Here's an example:

df_catchment = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/atamb/Box/Stream Team Dream Team/allDailyFlowData.csv',encoding="ISO-8859-1")

Here's a picture of what it should look like when you click properties.
